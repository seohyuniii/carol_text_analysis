White Christmas
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
and since we're no place to go
Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow!
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hod me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow!
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
he don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
he just says, 'Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow'
Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
his girl by his side and the lights turned low
he just says, 'Let it snow, Let it snow'

Rockin' Around the christmas Tree
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling
when you hear voices singing, Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Woah, you will get a sentimental feeling
when you hеar
Voices singing, Lеt's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, Jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bell ring
snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dacing and prancing in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
What a bright time it the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
to go gliding in a one horse sleigh
giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
jingle around the clock
Mix and a mingle in the jingle feet
That' the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingke bell time
Dacing and prancing in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
what a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glingle horse, pick up your feet
jingle around the clock
Mix and a mingle in the jingle' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
(They know that Santa's on his way)
(With toys and goodies on his sleigh)

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said

Merry Christmas to you
(Merry Christmas to you )

Sleigh Ride
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo!
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two

A Holly Jolly Christmas
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Now I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
Oh, ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
