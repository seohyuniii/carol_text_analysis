It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
Sure, it's Christmas once more

Mistletoe
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I’mma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I’mma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santa's coming tonight,
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I’mma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Aye, love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Aye, love, don't you buy me nothing
'cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That’s a merry, merry Christmas
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I’mma be under the mistletoe
I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I’mma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe, under the mistletoe
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe,
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh

Santa tell me
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking around the room
"Let it Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, babe
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fire place, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh-oh-oh
Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa, tell me, 'cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me, tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if you're really there (tell me, Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year (if he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me, do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Underneath The Tree
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight
I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents (oh, you're all I need), what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
(Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need
(Underneath the tree)
Underneath the tree
Tonight
(Oh you're all I need)
(Underneath)
(Underneath the tree)

For my pants to start vibrating
Baby text me Merry Christmas

It's the least that we can do Merry Christmas!

All alone on christmas
The cold wind is blowing and the streets are getting dark
I'm writting you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringing Saint John, The Divine
I get a little lonely every year around this time
The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockafella's tree
People window shoppin' on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you
I wanna know
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Where do lonely hearts go?
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
I hope you can bring us some cheer this year
The mothers and children in the street again
Do you remember sleigh ridin' in the snow?
And dancin' all night to "Baby, please come home"
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street
I wanna know
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Where do lonely hearts go?
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
I'm all grown up, and it's the same you'll see
I'm writing you this letter, 'cause I still believe
Dear Santa, I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here?
I wanna know
I wanna know
Where do lonely hearts go?
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Nobody ought to be all alone
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas (alone on Christmas)
Nobody ought to be alone (I wanna know)
Nobody ought to be alone (Where do lonely hearts go?)
Nobody ought to be alone

Snowman
Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby

'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on, let's go

My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey
Without legs to run, honey
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby
If you don't have ears, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on, let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily

My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby
